_"You can't teach an old dog new tricks."_
Or so the saying goes.
But is this true? 
It all depends on your attitude. 
Growth requires change, and change can be scary. 
The growth mindset teaches that with the right attitude, you can embrace change and face the challenges needed to grow. 

So what kind of mindset helps you get into a growth mentality? 
I recently read an [article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindsetand), and a few thoughts stood out to help challenge and push me towards success as I embrace a huge life change: ***my career***. 

My name is Eva Grace. After spending over a decade working with youth, I have decided to combine my passions for art, youth, and photography, and launch a new career as a web developer. You can follow along with me in this grand new adventure on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvaGraceSmith)

* **Challenges:**
The growth mindset embraces challenges rather than avoiding them. I need to refuse to let pessimism and fear rule my thinking, which could keep me from ever starting. Changing a career is a huge challenge, but I need to embrace it and focus on the "why" to get me through the "hard"

* **Obstacles:**
The growth mindset continues to persist when faced with obstacles rather than losing focus. This is a huge challenge for me. It is so easy to find a reason to focus on the many distractions that bombard me throughout the day. Recognizing these distractions as a barrier to overcoming an obstacle I am trying to work through, I can challenge and redirect my focus back on to the task at hand. 

* **Effort:**
The growth mindset recognizes that effort is required for growth. The effort can be painful, but a growth mindset focuses you back on the reward at the end of the effort, versus getting discouraged by the effort, and losing sight of your goal.
