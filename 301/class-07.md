### [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/what-google-learned-in-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

### If you took Code 201, skim this article again for a refresher. If you did not take Code 201, read this article and think about how it can influence the way you work with your partners during pair programming.

* "Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.

* Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.

* Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

* Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

* Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals."

* I can see how applying these principles can lead to healthy team dynamics. Knowing that you are going to be treated with respect helps open the door to positive interact and the ability to take risks, to learn and grow. 
* Having clear expectations across the board gives everyone clarity on what they need to do, and to trust what others will be doing. 
* Dependability. You can be as nice as you please, but if you don't put forth work that is quality, or on time, others will have to pick up your slack, which puts unnecessary pressure on the team.
* Meaning- If you don't have a strong why for doing what you are doing, your motivation will be lacking, and the temptation to slack is that much greater. 
* Impact- Positive reinforcement and being a meaningful part of a team can help inspire and motive you. 

### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

#### Who is Roy Fielding?
* "He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser."

#### Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
* "Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines."


#### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* "is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page."

#### What does a GET do?
* Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other

#### What does a POST do?
* When one system needs to add something to another system

#### What does PUT do?
*  when a system wants to replaces something in another system


#### What does PATCH do?
* a partial update
