1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
Alt attributes enable screen readers to read the information about on-page images for the benefit of a person with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, or who is otherwise unable to view the images on the page. Alt text will be displayed in place of an image if an image file cannot load.
