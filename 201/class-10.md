## Readings: Debugging


### What Went Wrong? 

[Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong).

#### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors are usually spelling errors or typos.
Logic errors are when the program is working but not returning the results you want.

#### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Lol. I am always missing my semi-colon. At this point in my learning, knowing naturally when a colon, or a comma, or a semi colon is appropriate isn't happening. Same for brackets versus parenthesis. I am sure as time and repetition and comprehension increase this will improve. Much like it has in HTML and CSS, which are a lot easier for me to spot errors in. 

#### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
Being great at troubleshooting is integral to being a great developer. If everything ran perfect, there wouldn't be the need to fix them. 


[The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger).

#### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software 
The JS debugger tool allows you to enter your code at any point and inspect the steps to see where the code is going, and what it is doing. It is like following a cookie crumb trail. If you know it isn't leading to the right gingerbread house, you better change the path or logic to get the right candy. 

#### Define what a breakpoint is.
A defined pause in your code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code.

#### What is the call stack?
The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
