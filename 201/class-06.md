### JavaScript Object Basics

How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

What are some advantages to creating object literals?

How do objects differ from arrays?

Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.

Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
