#### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.



#### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
