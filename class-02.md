GUI= Graphical User Interface

Terminal is NOT a GUI :D

You can have more than one Terminal open at a time. Ie:
	1 in which I am doing my work
	2 Bringing up ancillary data
	3 Viewing Manual pages

Command line: text based interface to the system

Linux file system is hierarchical
Root dir

Absolute Path- specify a location in relation to the root directory

 Relative Paths- specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system


Linux is Case Sensitive- Beware of silly typos.

Everything is a file under Linux

Once in the editor you can add changes to your project.

*Shortcut: The up and down arrow will toggle through commands you have already entered! 

File [path]  obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is. 

.before file name makes it hidden

Man [command] = explain the command
(Use “q” (quit) to exit the man
