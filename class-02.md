# Class 02 Reading Notes #

##Code Editor features:

* *code completion*. Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.
* *Emmet* shorthand language will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine.
* *Syntax Highlighting* is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text.
* *themes* will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well.
* *Extensions* are like plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that you wouldn’t have otherwise.




## Command Line Tutorial

GUI= Graphical User Interface

Terminal is NOT a GUI :D

You can have more than one Terminal open at a time. Ie:
	1 in which I am doing my work
	2 Bringing up ancillary data
	3 Viewing Manual pages

Command line: text based interface to the system

Linux file system is hierarchical
Root dir

Absolute Path- specify a location in relation to the root directory

 Relative Paths- specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system


Linux is Case Sensitive- Beware of silly typos.

Everything is a file under Linux

Once in the editor you can add changes to your project.

*Shortcut: The up and down arrow will toggle through commands you have already entered! 

File [path]  obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is. 

.before file name makes it hidden

Man [command] = explain the command
(Use “q” (quit) to exit the man
