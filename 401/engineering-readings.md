## Engineering Readings
### Developing Problem-solving skills
____

Solving problems is the meat and potatoes of developing. Learning to do so with skill and efficiency will help grow you in to a better developer.

___

*"Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke*



### [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
___

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

*As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.*

*“Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”*

 Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:

* Create a list
* Sort a list or array
* Create a map or dictionary (key:value pair in js)
* Loop through a list, or dictionary
* Parse strings
* Convert from string to int, int to string, etc


### [Think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)
___


What should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand
    * This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).
2. Plan
    * Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.
3. Divide
    * Break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
4. Stuck?
    * The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.
5. Practice
    * Find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).

### [The five why's](https://www.mindtools.com/a3mi00v/5-whys)
___

* Continue asking why, follow the trail to go deeper into finding a solution. 

### [The Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)
____

* Frame the learning process in the right way. Don't be concerned with failure. Focus on the end goal.

* **Life Gamification:** Learn from, but don't focus on failures.

### Additional Questions:

##### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

* My own unique perspective and experiences

##### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Use the rubber duck (rubber or human) to talk through the issue

2. Break the problem down into more simple steps

3. Change my mentality to be more curious than irritated by errors.

## Things I want to know more about

* I want to continually develop and challenge myself to learn. To fail forward. To be resilient and persistent. I want to challenge myself to stay curious, and find productive, healthy ways to continually grow and learn.
