Read todayâ€™s [Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-14/lab/)


### Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

1. Continuing on the School Educational system theme, an additional aspect to be added would be the interaction between students and teachers and assignment. Teachers creat assignments and due dates, student work on them and turn them in. Teachers grade the assignments and provide feedback. Students are able to read the feedback and reassess as needed. 

2. Another idea would be a community garden. The garden would need volunteers to plant, water, maintain, harvest and distribute produce to consumers.
