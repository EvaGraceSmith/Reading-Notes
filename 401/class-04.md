##### What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

* SQL databases are a good fit for the complex query intensive environment.

##### What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

* Both SQL and NoSQL databases can be a good fit for hierarchical data storage, depending on the specific requirements and use case. SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL support hierarchical data storage through the use of recursive queries, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra can store hierarchical data in nested documents or collections.

##### Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

"Think of a database as a big container where we store lots of information. When we have a lot of data to store, we need to make sure that the database is able to handle all of it and that it can still work quickly and efficiently.

Now, imagine you have a big bookshelf with lots of books on it. If you need to add more books to the shelf, you might run out of space pretty quickly. That's kind of like how a SQL database works. It's like a bookshelf with limited space, and when you start adding more and more data to it, it can become slower and less efficient.

On the other hand, a NoSQL database is more like a filing cabinet with lots of drawers. Each drawer can hold a lot of information, and if you need to add more drawers, you can just keep adding more and more. This makes it easier to handle a lot of data without slowing down.

So, in summary, SQL databases are good for smaller amounts of data that can fit on a "bookshelf," while NoSQL databases are better for larger amounts of data that need to be stored in lots of "drawers" that can be easily expanded as needed." - ChatGPT
