###### Recursion: Recursion is where a function calls itself. 

* it is used to make the code cleaner and easier to understand.
* Because a recursive function calls itself, it can be easy to write a function that creates an infinite loop. 
* To prevent this, Recursive functions have two cases. 

1. a Base Case- when the function does not call itself again.
2. a Recursive Case- when the function calls itself

##### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?


##### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
* make sure you have a base case where the function does not call itself, in addition to the recursive case.
