*"Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke*



[Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
___

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

*As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.*

*“Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”*

 Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:

* Create a list
* Sort a list or array
* Create a map or dictionary (key:value pair in js)
* Loop through a list, or dictionary
* Parse strings
* Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

What should you do when you encounter a new problem?
1. Understand
    This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).
2. Plan
    Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.
3. Divide
    Break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
4. Stuck?
    The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.
5. Practice
    Find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).
