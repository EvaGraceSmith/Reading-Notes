## Implementation: Hash Tables

Imagine you have a library with many shelves and books. Each book has a unique number assigned to it, and there are labels on the shelves indicating the range of book numbers that go on each shelf.

Now, let's say you have a collection of books and you want to keep them organized in this library. Instead of randomly placing each book on any shelf, you have a smart system that tells you exactly which shelf to put each book on based on its number.

For example, when you have a book with the number 1234, the smart system tells you to put it on the shelf labeled "1200-1299." When you have a book with the number 5678, it tells you to put it on the shelf labeled "5600-5699." And the same goes for other books.

Now, why is this system so useful? Well, let's say you want to find a specific book later, like the one with the number 5678. Instead of searching through every shelf and checking each book until you find it, you can use the smart system. It tells you to go directly to the shelf labeled "5600-5699" where you know the book will be waiting for you. It saves you time and effort!

In computer terms, this library is like a hash table, and the shelves with labels are like "buckets" in the hash table. The smart system represents a "hash function" that helps you determine which bucket or shelf to put each item in based on its characteristics, like the book number.

So, a hash table is like a library with shelves and books, where each book is placed on a specific shelf based on its number. When you want to find a book, you can use the smart system or hash function to go directly to the right shelf without searching through every book in the library. It's an efficient way to organize and find things! - ChatGPT
