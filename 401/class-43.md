# React Native


## [Getting started with react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

### Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

#### Three core components of React Native are:
* **View**: A fundamental UI component that acts as a container for other components and helps in creating the structure and layout of the app.
* **Text**: Used for displaying text content in the app. It supports styling, formatting, and handling user interactions.
* **Image**: Enables the display of images in the app, allowing for customization, resizing, and handling of different image sources.

### What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?

React Native solves the problem of building mobile apps for multiple platforms (iOS and Android) using a single codebase. It leverages native components to render UI elements, providing a native-like experience to the users while using JavaScript to write the logic.

### What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?

The building blocks of a React Native app are components. These components are reusable UI elements that can be combined to create the app's user interface. Compared to a React app, React Native uses different components that map to native UI elements rather than HTML elements.

## [expo](https://expo.io/)

### What solution does expo provide?

Expo provides a set of tools and services for building, deploying, and managing React Native applications. It simplifies the development process by offering features like a development server, built-in UI components, device access APIs, and over-the-air updates.

### Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.

Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the "managed" workflow. It handles tasks such as project configuration, native code compilation, and publishing, allowing developers to focus more on writing JavaScript code rather than dealing with platform-specific setup.

### What is the difference between React Native and Expo?

React Native is a framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript, while Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native. Expo provides additional features and simplifies the development process by abstracting away some of the lower-level complexities of React Native, making it easier to get started with mobile app development.

## [expo snack](https://snack.expo.io/)

### Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?

Expo Snack is an online platform that allows you to write and test React Native code directly in your browser. It provides a web-based development environment where you can write code, preview the app in real-time, and share the code snippets with others.

## [ejecting](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject)

### What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?

"Ejecting" in the context of Expo means converting an Expo project into a regular React Native project. When you eject, you gain direct access to the native code and configuration files of your app. This allows for more fine-grained control and customization, but it also means taking on the responsibility of managing native dependencies and updates.

### When should you not eject?

You should not eject from Expo if you are comfortable with the limitations and features provided by Expo and do not require extensive customization or native module integration. Ejecting adds complexity to the project, requires familiarity with native development, and may increase the development time and maintenance overhead.

### Why might you choose to eject?

You might choose to eject from Expo when you need to incorporate native modules that are not supported by Expo or require deep customization and control over the native code. Ejecting allows you to access and modify the native code, integrate custom native modules, and have more flexibility in terms of platform-specific configurations and optimizations.
