## Event Driven Programming
___

Nearly everything in the world is “Event Driven”, and most actions in JS are event driven. Learning how to program this way helps us create applications that are relevant and useful to the world around us.

1. #### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is called EventEmitter.
2. #### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) adds value to Event Driven Programming by promoting the idea that each unit or object should handle its own behavior. With OOP, different objects can interact with each other and trigger events, which can be processed by other objects. This combination of OOP and Event Driven Programming helps in managing complex applications and organizing the flow of communication between objects.
3. #### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Event Driven Programming is also useful on the backend using Node.js. Just like how events are triggered in a web browser when you interact with a webpage, on the backend, events can be used to handle various tasks and respond to different actions. For example, in a chat room application, we can use event handlers to alert everyone when a new user joins the chat. Events can be triggered when a user logs in, sends a message, logs out, or performs any other actions. By using Event Driven Programming, we can build dynamic and responsive applications that handle events efficiently and ensure proper communication between different components of the system.
