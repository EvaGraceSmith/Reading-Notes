### The Growth Mindset
___



I don't think anyone with a background similar to mine would alter course and attempt an endeavor as challenging as advanced software development, without some hope that, indeed, our minds can grow and change and develop. These article are "preaching to the choir" so to speak. They also give good reminders and inspiration on how to better achieve these goals.

   This article challenges you to keep learning, to not stop once formal training has ended. There are many benefits listed but one of the primary reasons for those in technical fields is to stay relevant. A highlight from the article:

   "The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

* Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
* Repeated often
* Feedback on results in continuously available
* It's highly demanding mentally
* It's difficult
* It requires good goals"


#### [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en) (10 minutes)

**"Not Yet ""**
The power of learning can come from changing your mindset from **"I can't** because **"I can't yet"**

If you can challenge yourself to understand you are continually developing, to keep a mindset that embraces growth, that abilities can be developed, you can learn from your failure. You can grow from them. 

Encourage children to have a growth mindset through "praising the process that kids engage in, their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their improvement. This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient."

#### [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit.](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance/comments) 

I love these two quotes from her speech. They empassion me as I attempt a very difficult new learning challenge. It also inspires me to encourage my children to develop the "grit" quality.

"Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint."

"So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset." This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition."


####[Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success). 

Contentment is elusive and judgement is rampant. 

How do you solve this?

"So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success, but we should make sure that they are our own. We should focus in on our ideas, and make sure that we own them; that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want, but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want, and find out, at the end of the journey, that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along."

Or as I have long told myself "begin with the end in mind."
