 I found the article about the Software Engineering Code of Ethics informative and thought-provoking. The introduction states that without aspirations, the code becomes legalistic and tedious, while without details, it sounds empty. It's relatable to our profession, where finding the right balance between high-sounding ideals and practical implementation can be a challenge. The principles listed, from acting in the public interest to advancing the integrity of the profession, resonate with the responsibility we have as software engineers. The code's emphasis on public welfare and ethical decision-making serves as a reminder that our work can have a significant impact on society.

 
 ## Ethics in the workplace

 ### [The code I am still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

 This article explores the ethical challenges faced by a junior developer who was confronted with a morally questionable coding task. Assigned to work on a website targeting teenage girls, the developer discovered that the goal was to subtly promote a drug associated with severe side effects, including depression and suicidal thoughts. Initially viewing it as just another job, the situation took a distressing turn when they learned about a young girl who tragically ended her life after taking the drug. This experience prompted the author to reflect on the responsibility of developers to consider the potential harm their code may cause. With technology playing an increasingly significant role in our lives, it is vital to prioritize ethics and ensure our creations align with values that prioritize the well-being of users. This story serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of ethical decision-making in the tech industry and the need to prioritize the welfare of individuals as we develop products and solutions.

 ## Ethics in Technology


[Self Driving Car Ethics](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

This article delves into the ethical dilemmas surrounding self-driving cars and the decisions they may face in life-threatening situations. It presents a hypothetical scenario where a self-driving car must make a split-second moral judgment: should it prioritize the safety of its passengers or the greater good of avoiding harm to others? The article highlights the complexity of this question and the lack of consensus on how self-driving cars should be programmed to handle such situations. It also addresses concerns about public acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as individual fears and moral preferences may influence their adoption. While automakers and suppliers downplay the risks, experts emphasize the need to establish guidelines and regulations to ensure responsible decision-making by self-driving cars. I think this article provokes critical thinking about the moral and ethical dimensions of technology and prompts further discussions on how to navigate these complex ethical considerations in the development and deployment of self-driving cars.
