##### Stack:
Think of a stack like stacking plates in your cupboard. 

When loading clean plates, you always put them on the top of the pile of plates. 

If you want use a plate would you grab from the center of the bottom of the stack? No! 

You would grab the TOP plate. 

That is a stack!

##### Queue

 Think of a queue like taking your car to the automated car wash. 

 Each car lines up behind another. 

 One car at a time goes in, in order, and then goes out of the car wash in the same order as they went in.
