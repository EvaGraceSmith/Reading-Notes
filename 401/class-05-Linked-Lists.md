#### Sql v noSql

A good analogy to compare sql versus noSql comes from a child's bedroom. Sql would be like their dresser drawers, with items clearly labeled. Everything has a neat organized compartment. Items are easy to access and find, but there is no flexibility for odd shaped or large items. NoSql would be more like a toy box. It has a great range of flexibility for storing items of any shape and size.
