Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda
Below you will find some reading material, code samples, and some additional resources that support today’s topic and the upcoming lecture.
## [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

#### What is Amazon S3?


Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based storage service offered by Amazon Web Services. It provides a simple way to store and retrieve data over the internet. Think of it like a virtual storage space where you can keep your files, documents, images, or videos securely and access them whenever you need, from anywhere.

#### Name some use cases for Amazon S3.

Amazon S3 is used for data backup, content storage and distribution, data archiving, and big data analytics. It provides secure and scalable storage for files, websites, and applications, enabling reliable access and cost-effective data management.



#### Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.

1. Scalable Storage: Easily store and retrieve any amount of data, scaling seamlessly as your needs grow.
2. Durability and Reliability: Data is redundantly stored across multiple facilities, ensuring high durability and availability.
3. Cost-Effective: Pay only for the storage used, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments.
4. Security and Compliance: Robust security features and compliance certifications to protect and meet regulatory requirements.
5. Integration with AWS Services: Seamlessly integrate with other AWS services for data analysis, content delivery, and more.

[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

#### What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. You can execute code in response to events and pay only for the compute time consumed by your code.

#### Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. You can execute code in response to events and pay only for the compute time consumed by your code.


#### Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

"Serverless" means you can run your code without worrying about managing servers. You just focus on writing your code, and the cloud provider takes care of all the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance, allowing you to easily deploy and run your applications or functions.

### [CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

#### What is a CDN?


A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers that helps deliver web content, such as images, videos, and web pages, to users based on their location. CDNs improve website performance and user experience by reducing latency and handling high traffic loads efficiently.

#### How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

A CDN works by caching and delivering website content from servers located near the website visitor. When a visitor requests a webpage, the CDN routes the request to the nearest server, reducing latency. The server then delivers the cached content, improving website speed and user experience.

#### What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) improves website performance by reducing latency, increasing page load speeds, and enhancing user experience. It achieves this by caching content in multiple servers distributed globally, enabling faster delivery of content to users and reducing strain on the origin server.

Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-17/)?

I am hoping to learn more about Lambda's.
