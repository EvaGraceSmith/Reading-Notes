### Look over the above content.

Teach us two things about Next.js.

#### Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

* An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
* Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
* Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
* Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
* Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
* Development environment with Fast Refresh support
* API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
* Fully extendable

#### Teach us two things about Gatsby.js.

The Gatsby command line interface (CLI) is a tool that lets you quickly create new Gatsby-powered sites and run commands for developing Gatsby sites.

The CLI is a published npm package, which means you can install it using npm.

Gatsby.js is a popular open-source framework used for building modern, high-performance websites and web applications. It combines the power of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with the benefits of static site generation.

At its core, Gatsby.js leverages the concept of static site generation (SSG), where web pages are pre-built during the build process rather than being generated dynamically on each user request. This approach offers several advantages such as improved site performance, better search engine optimization (SEO), and enhanced security.

Here are some key features and concepts associated with Gatsby.js:

1. React-based: Gatsby.js is built on top of React, which enables developers to use React components and leverage its efficient rendering capabilities to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

2. GraphQL Data Layer: Gatsby.js incorporates GraphQL, a query language for APIs, to efficiently fetch and manage data from various sources. With GraphQL, developers can specify the data requirements for each page and fetch only the necessary data, reducing payload size and improving performance.

3. Static Site Generation: Gatsby.js uses SSG to generate static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during the build process. This allows websites to load quickly as the content is already pre-rendered, resulting in snappy page transitions and improved user experience.

4. Plugins and Ecosystem: Gatsby.js has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. These plugins enable features like image optimization, content management system (CMS) integrations, SEO enhancements, and more. Developers can choose from a wide range of plugins or even develop their own to customize their Gatsby.js projects.

5. Performance Optimization: Gatsby.js incorporates several performance optimization techniques out of the box. This includes features like code splitting, lazy loading of images, preloading and prefetching resources, and generating optimized versions of images in different formats and sizes.

6. Developer Experience: Gatsby.js emphasizes a great developer experience with features like hot reloading, which allows developers to see changes instantly during development, and a robust plugin system that simplifies extending functionality. It also provides a comprehensive set of development tools and integrations for testing, debugging, and deployment.
