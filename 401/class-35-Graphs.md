Imagine you have a group of friends and you want to draw a map of their friendships. Each friend is a vertex, and the lines connecting them are edges. This map is like a graph! Some friends are directly connected, while others may need a few connections to reach each other. You can count how many friends each person has (their degree) or see who is directly connected to them (their neighbors). You can also have arrows to show the direction of friendship, like who considers whom as their best friend. Graphs help us understand these connections and explore various types of relationships among people or objects.
