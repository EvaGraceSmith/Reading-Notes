## Authorization/Authentication

Reinforce learning from this module and create a project that could potentially shorten my learning curve during midterm projects.

### Readings
___

#### Read today’s [Lab Requirements](https://canvas.instructure.com/calendar#view_name=month&view_start=2023-05-21)


##### Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the allotted time.

1. Classroom management system that keeps track of students, their schedule, grades, assignments due and teacher.Implement authentication and access control to restrict certain operations, such as assignment creation or modification, to authorized users. Use RESTful CRUD operations for database management.


2. Event Management System: Build an event management application where users can create, manage, and RSVP to events. Implement authentication and access control to restrict certain operations, such as event creation or modification, to authorized users. Use RESTful CRUD operations for event management.


### Bookmark and Review

#### [Review API Server Build](https://canvas.instructure.com/calendar#view_name=month&view_start=2023-05-21)

An Express/Node.js based server designed to be a “model agnostic” REST API server, which can perform CRUD operations on any data model

#### Review Auth Server Build

An Express/Node.js based server using a custom “authentication” module that is designed to handle user registration and sign in using Basic, Bearer, or OAuth along with a custom “authorization” module that will grant/deny users access to the server based on their role or permissions level.

#### Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/)?


Integrate all the amazing tools we have learned this week into a single project 


## Things I want to know more about

I am curious if one piece is easier to implement than the others.
