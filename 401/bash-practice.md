## Submitting Your Work
For each of the following segments of [Bash Command Line Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) on ryanstutorials.net, completely read through and complete each of the activities in your own terminal. As you complete each segment’s activities, take a moment to document your learnings and observations.

#### [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php) - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.
___
**Learnings and Observations**

* What is it?

"A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text."

* How does it work?

"The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands."

* How do I get one?

"If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up."

___

* Everything is a File
* Linux is an Extensionless System
